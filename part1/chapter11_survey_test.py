The setUp() Method
On top created a new instance of AnonymousSurvey in each test method, and we 
created new responses in each method. The unittest.TestCase class has a setUp() 
method that allows you to create these objects once and then use them in each 
of your test methods. When you include a setUp() method in a TestCase class, 
Python runs the setUp() method before running each method starting with test_. A
ny objects created in the setUp() method are then available in each 
test method you write.

'''
When a test case is running, Python prints one character for each unit test as 
it is completed. A passing test prints a dot, a test that results in an error 
prints an E, and a test that results in a failed assertion prints an F. This is 
why youâ€™ll see a different number of dots and characters on the first line of 
output when you run your test cases. If a test case takes a long time to run 
because it contains many unit tests, you can watch these results to get a sense 
of how many tests are passing.
